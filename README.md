The objective of Task 1 is to develop a Java-based file handling utility capable of performing essential file operations such as reading, writing, and modifying text files. This task helps interns gain a practical understanding of how Java interacts with the file system, which is a foundational skill for any software developer. File handling is crucial in real-world applications, from managing configuration files to logging user activities or storing data persistently.

Java provides robust support for file handling through its java.io, java.nio.file, and java.util packages. Interns are expected to use these built-in libraries to create a program that demonstrates reading content from a file, writing new content to it, and modifying existing content.

The file utility should support the following core functionalities:

Reading a File: The program must be able to open a specified text file and read its contents line by line. This involves using classes like BufferedReader or Scanner, which help in reading text efficiently.

Writing to a File: The utility should allow writing new content to a file. This can either overwrite the existing content or append to it. Classes like BufferedWriter, FileWriter, or PrintWriter are commonly used for this operation.

Modifying a File: To modify specific content within a file, the program typically reads all content into memory, makes necessary changes, and writes the modified content back. This task teaches the intern how to work with temporary storage, data structures (like lists or arrays), and control flow mechanisms to identify and edit targeted lines or words.

The deliverable is a Java program that clearly demonstrates all the above operations with proper documentation and user interaction. The program should be menu-driven or provide a command-line interface where users can choose operations such as view, add, edit, or delete content from a file.

This task strengthens the intern's understanding of:

File paths and file objects in Java.

Exception handling using try-catch-finally blocks, especially IOException and FileNotFoundException.

Buffered and unbuffered streams, and the importance of efficient I/O operations.

Best practices like closing resources using try-with-resources to prevent memory leaks.

Moreover, the intern also gains exposure to text processing, which is useful when working with logs, data transformation, or even simple databases stored in text format. The program should be designed with modularity, separating logic into different methods for better readability and maintainability.

By completing Task 1, interns develop the skills necessary to build backend features like configuration management, data import/export tools, and basic log analyzers. These are commonly needed in enterprise applications and automation tools.

In conclusion, this task serves as a foundational exercise in file I/O operations in Java, preparing the intern to handle real-world scenarios involving data storage, processing, and manipulation. It enhances their ability to work with external data sources and contributes significantly to their understanding of Java programming beyond console-based applications.
